# Dropout-of-Education
About Education and Status

In this project, we are going to discuss about dropout of education and its causes.
We find that the major reasons of dropout could be concluded as Gender problems, Economical problems, and Educational problems.
Females, Debtors, and students who are weak at their secondary education are easier to drop out of advanced education.
In order to reduce the rate of dropping out, as educators, we need to focus on the students who have economical problems and gender problems.

# Aspect
Nowadays, Education is one of the most important fields in our society, and the labor force with advanced education is the basis of any industry. In other words, it is important for children (even for most adults) to be educated in todayâ€™s world. However, there exist risks that students may drop out, and educators are interested in the reasons for this phenomenon. We need to know what factors influence our students and lead them to drop out. Thus the core idea of this project is to predict Student Retention and identify the risk factors for dropout. Using data from Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success, we would be able to find the factors that may affect the status of students. In this project, Elastic Net Regression has been chosen to construct the model, then developed via Both-direction stepwise. After analysis, the top factors that have a negative influence on students are Debtor, Gender, Educational.special.needs, and Daytime.evening.attendance. According to the analysis results, we would be able to generalize the characteristics of dropout students. As educators, it means we need to pay more attention to the students who have these characteristics.
